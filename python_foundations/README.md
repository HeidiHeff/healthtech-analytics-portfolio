# Python Foundations

## Overview

This folder contains foundational Python exercises and small utilities developed while completing introductory and structured Python coursework.

The focus is on building disciplined programming habits, including clean function design, input validation, modular structure, and basic file handling.

---

## Skills Developed

- Core data types and control flow
- Functions and modular design
- Input validation
- File I/O (CSV, JSON)
- Basic error handling
- Readable and maintainable code structure

---

## Representative Exercises

Examples may include:

- CSV file parsing utilities
- Structured data readers (EHR-style JSON formats)
- Simple healthcare-oriented calculation tools
- Input validation and transformation scripts

---

## Purpose

These exercises establish the programming baseline required for later work in:

- Data cleaning pipelines
- SQL integration
- Statistical modeling
- Reproducible analytics workflows

This section reflects structured skill development rather than production-grade projects.

# Synthetic Healthcare Claims Data Engineering

## Overview

This project builds a controlled 20,000-row synthetic healthcare claims dataset and a reproducible cleaning pipeline designed to simulate real-world healthcare data integrity challenges.

The workflow includes intentional corruption injection, structured validation logic, reproducible cleaning transformations, and measurable recovery accuracy against a known ground truth dataset.

All data is synthetic.

## Objectives

- Generate a structured synthetic claims dataset (`clean_claims.csv`)
- Inject controlled data quality issues (`raw_claims.csv`)
- Detect and quantify all corruption types
- Implement reproducible cleaning logic (`cleaned_claims.csv`)
- Compare cleaned output to ground truth
- Produce accuracy and recovery metrics

---

## Injected Data Quality Issues

The raw dataset includes controlled examples of:

- Missing values
- Duplicate records
- Type and format errors
- Logical inconsistencies (e.g., invalid date relationships)
- Domain violations (e.g., invalid codes or values)
- Statistical outliers

---

## Pipeline Structure

### Dataset Generation
Creates the clean ground truth dataset and injects defined corruption rates.

### Data Quality Reporting
Generates diagnostics identifying counts and distributions of corruption types.

### Cleaning Pipeline
Applies structured transformation logic including:
- Standardization
- Validation enforcement
- Safe type conversion
- Duplicate resolution
- Logical rule corrections

### Accuracy Comparison
Compares cleaned results against ground truth and quantifies:
- Recovery percentage by error category
- Overall dataset restoration rate

## Deliverables

- `clean_claims.csv`
- `raw_claims.csv`
- `data_quality_report.csv`
- `cleaned_claims.csv`
- `accuracy_report.csv`
- `summary_metrics.csv`

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python data engineering workflow design
- Structured validation and correction logic
- Data integrity reporting
- QA-style measurable recovery analysis
- Reproducible analytics execution

---

## Why This Matters

Healthcare analytics depends on reliable upstream data quality.  

This project emphasizes disciplined validation before transformation, measurable correction accuracy, and conservative correction logic designed for regulated data environments.

## Overview

This portfolio documents a structured progression into healthcare data analytics, with an emphasis on data integrity, reproducibility, statistical reasoning, and operational impact.

Projects are intentionally aligned to a tiered roadmap:

HealthTech Data Analyst → Analytics Engineer → AI-Savvy Healthcare Data Strategist

All datasets are synthetic or publicly available. No real patient data is used.

---

## Background

I previously worked extensively with Python for test scripting and lightweight application development within healthcare startup environments.  

This current progression focuses on formalizing and modernizing those foundational skills within structured analytics, data engineering workflows, and reproducible data validation systems.

## Portfolio Navigation

| Project | Focus Area | Core Skills Demonstrated | Status |
|----------|------------|--------------------------|--------|
| Synthetic Healthcare Claims Data Engineering | Data Quality & Cleaning | Python, Pandas, Validation Logic, QA Metrics | Active |
| Hospital Readmission SQL Analysis | SQL & KPI Analysis | Joins, CTEs, Window Functions | Planned |
| Patient No-Show Prediction Model | Statistical Modeling | Logistic Regression, Interpretation | Planned |
| Hospital Operations Dashboard | Business Intelligence | Power BI, KPI Framing | Planned |
| Telehealth Booking Experimentation | A/B Testing | Statistical Testing, Funnel Metrics | Planned |

Additional folders reflect future tiers, including Spark, streaming systems, and applied AI projects as capabilities expand.

## Featured Project

### Synthetic Healthcare Claims Data Engineering

A 20,000-row synthetic claims dataset with controlled data corruption.

Includes:

- Raw dataset with injected integrity issues  
- Reproducible cleaning pipeline  
- Data quality report  
- Accuracy comparison against ground truth  
- Summary metrics for downstream analytics  

This project demonstrates practical data validation, structured cleaning logic, and measurable recovery accuracy.
